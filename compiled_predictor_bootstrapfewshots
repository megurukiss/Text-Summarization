        "document": "A middle-school teacher in China has inked hundreds of sketches that are beyond be-leaf. Politics teacher Wang Lian, 35,  has created 1000 stunning ink drawings covering subjects as varied as cartoon characters and landscapes to animals, birds according to\u00a0the\u00a0People's Daily Online. The intricate scribbles on leaves feature Wang's favourite sites across the city of Nanjing, which include the Presidential Palace, Yangtze River Bridge, the ancient Jiming Temple and the Qinhuai River. Natural canvas: Artist and teacher Wang Lian has done hundreds of drawings, like this temple, on leaves she collects in the park and on the streets . Delicate: She uses an ink pen to gently draw the local scenes and buildings on the dried out leaves . 'Although teaching politics is my job, drawing is my passion and hobby,' said Wang. 'I first tried drawing on leaves about 10 years ago and fell in love with it as an art form immediately. 'It's like drawing on very old parchment paper, you have to be really careful that you don't damage the leaf because it is very fragile and this helps focus your attention and abilities.' Wang started giving the drawings away on\u00a0Christmas Eve in 2012 when her junior high school son came home saying he wanted to prepare some gifts for his classmates. Being an avid painter, Wang decided to give her son's friends unique presents of gingko leaf paintings. Wang loves gingko leaves and will often pick them up along Gingko Avenue, near to her school, in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu province. Every autumn she collects about 2,000 leaves from the ground to ensure she has enough to cover spoils too. Intricate: Teacher Wang has drawn hundreds of local scenes on leaves she has collected from the park . Hobby: The artist collects leaves every autumn and dries them out so she can sketch these impressive building scenes . 'The colour and shape of gingko leaves are particularly beautiful,' she said. 'I need to collect around 2000 leaves because this will include losses'. She takes them home where she then presses them between the pages of books. 'Luckily, I have quite a lot of books and I try to use old ones or ones that I've already read so I don't end up with nothing to read.' Once they are dried, she carefully takes each one and using an ink fountain pen creates her masterpieces. She said: 'Some people are into capturing beauty through photography, but for me, a digitalised image just isn't the same. New leaf:\u00a0Politics teacher Wang Lian has drawn hundreds of doodles on leaves for the last 10 years . 'By drawing what I see I become far more a part of the process and part of the final piece. 'One day I hope to be able to put my collection on display, but for now it's really just for my own pleasure.' Wang's leaf paintings are turned into bookmarks, postcards and sometimes even given as gifts to her her students so she can share the beauty of leaf paintings. But locals who have had the luck of being able to see Wang's art have been gobsmacked. Local art collector On Hao, 58, said: 'These are truly remarkable and beautiful creations. 'She has so much talent she is wasted in teaching.'",

        "document": "A man convicted of killing the father and sister of his former girlfriend in a fiery attack on the family's Southern California home was sentenced to death on Tuesday. Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .",

Dr Ashleigh Witt, who works as a medical registrar, posted a lengthy post on her blog discussing how she is frequently belittled because of her sex, with people regularly referring to her as a 'lady doctor' instead of just 'doctor'. She pointed out that she has also been judged by members of the profession in the higher ranks of her hospital who claimed she got into her position because she was pretty. Dr Ashleigh Witt, who works as a medical registrar in Melbourne . Writing on\u00a0blogspot.com, Dr Witt, from Melbourne, Australia, said: 'Sexual harassment is every time you call me \"blondie\" or \"Barbie\", every time you make a joke about my choice to wear a skirt not pants, every time you comment on my appearance rather than my skillset, every time you call me a \"lady doctor\" instead of a \"doctor\". 'Sexual harassment is two weeks ago when I lead a code blue which saved a woman on the labour ward and my male colleague arrived after the fact and said, \"they shouldn\u2019t send you up here, you\u2019re too clucky\". She continued: 'It\u2019s also the consultant who commented that I\u2019d \"obviously gotten to where I was at a young age because I was pretty\" (Um, maybe I\u2019m actually good at my job?). 'It\u2019s the surgical registrar who told me if I wanted to be taken seriously I needed to dye my hair dark.' Dr Witt wrote the essay in response to recent comments by a respected Australian vascular surgeon called\u00a0Dr Gabrielle McMullin, who suggested women should accept sexual advances by their male colleagues instead of making a complaint that could damage their career. Dr Witt, who says she has faced sexual harassment at work . Dr Witt believes that sexual comments of the kind she has experienced are causing serious damage to the medical profession. She said: 'These seemingly harmless comments, coupled with the line that we 'need to take a joke', teach women in medicine that they need to just accept everyday sexual harassment. 'And worse still, they encourage those deeds further along the spectrum of sexual harassment. 'Where do we draw the line between commenting on someone's appearance to commenting on her body to making an unwanted sexual advance? 'Clearly we're having a great deal of trouble with the grey zone, so why don't we stop subtle sexual harassment where it starts.' Dr Witt ended her blog post with a call to arms for female medical workers, suggesting that they point out sexual harassment when it happened to the person in question. She said: 'I\u2019m going to ask you,that this week you look out for subtle sexual harassment and call it out. 'Whether you\u2019re the med student, the consultant, the nurse, the dietician or the plaster tech, that when you hear a comment towards a woman that would not be made if she was a man say \"hey! Let\u2019s not make jokes based on gender\", or \"I don't think that's appropriate.\" 'Maybe, just maybe, the tiny ripples of change could start here.' The blog, which was posted on Sunday, has since been praised by thousands around the world. \u200f@cathimon wrote on Twitter: Excellent piece.

'That's not usually how you land an armbar at that angle, but it works. It was a lot like judo transitions, where you scramble the second you hit the ground. 'I made that up on the fly, to be honest.

'The study of her remains shows the typical destructive . damage provoked by the extension of a breast cancer as a . metastasis,' he said in a statement on Tuesday. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed'an extraordinary deterioration'. According to the World Health Organisation's cancer research agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within 20 years. Despite being one of the world's leading causes of death . today, cancer is virtually absent in archaeological records . compared to other diseases - which has given rise to the idea . that cancers are mainly attributable to modern lifestyles and to . people living for longer. 'The team from University of Jaen has confirmed that the woman lived at the end of the 6th Dynasty (2200 BCE) and was part of the \u00e9lite of the southernmost town of Egypt, Elephantine,' the statement said. 'The virulence of the disease impeded her to carry out any kind of labor, but she was treated and taken care during a long period until her death. ' The University of Jaen began the archaeological excavations in Qubbet el-Hawa in 2008 and their major goal is to reconstruct the life and funerary rituals of the governors of Elephantine and their families who lived between 2250 and 1750 BCE.

But the finding, along with evidence reported last year by . British researchers of metastatic cancer in a 3,000-year-old . skeleton found in a tomb in modern Sudan, suggests cancer was . around in the Nile Valley in ancient times.

Last year a unique MRI scan on a 2,500 year old mummified Siberian 'princess' has revealed she died after suffering from acute breast cancer. Preserved in ice in an elaborate grave in the Altai Mountains, the ancient woman - famous for her remarkable tattoos - took cannabis to dull the ravages of her illnesses, experts have also discovered. Dug from her permafrost burial chamber on the high Ukok Plateau in 1993, analysis of her remains earlier highlighted sophisticated tattoos of 'great artistry' of fantastical creatures, while in her tomb was also found clothing and headdresses, a make-up bag, and a stash of cannabis, enabling experts to build a detailed picture of her life and looks.

Mark Hughes looks on with a smile as his Stoke City side cruise to a 2-0 win over Everton on Wednesday . He has signed with remarkable shrewdness, shaped his players into a cohesive style, and overcome the set-backs of regular injuries to key players to guide Stoke to 42 points after 28 games.

And all the while forking out less cash on recruits than Burnley. That is the bit to amaze. Hughes has committed \u00a31.2million on bringing in new players this season: \u00a3800,000 on brilliant Bojan from Barcelona, and \u00a3400,000 on young centre-back Dionatan Teixeira from Slovakian side Dukla Banska Bystrica.

Stoke also sold Cameron Jerome to Norwich and Ryan Shotton to Derby County for a combined cost of \u00a32m \u2013 so in all are around \u00a32.3m up on net transfer spend. No wonder Hughes is being rewarded with a new three-year contract that he is expected to sign in the coming days. His connections, influence, and words of persuasion played a big part in producing such positive market returns. The acquisition of Bojan, once the rising star of Barcelona, was smoothed by Hughes\u2019s association with the Catalan giants. The player\u2019s glistening form before he suffered a cruel knee injury, after initial struggles, a testament to Hughes\u2019s motivational skills. Bojan Krkic hit a rich vein of form before his season has ended by a knee ligament injury . Clearly the support network from chairman Peter Coates, a Stoke fan since a boy and generous benefactor, and chief executive Tony Scholes enables Hughes to work to his full potential. The foundations laid by Tony Pulis in getting Stoke up from the Championship seven years ago and stabilising the club as a Premier League presence will never be forgotten. But Hughes has built on that, altering the side\u2019s style to please the eye while retaining the strength of conviction which made Pulis\u2019s reign so successful. The four forwards in his 4-2-3-1 system are interchangeable, with Moses, Diouf, Bojan, Jon Walters, Marko Arnautovic, Stephen Ireland, Charlie Adam, and Peter Crouch forming various combinations throughout the campaign. No shining lights as such, they offer a mixture of pace, nimble dexterity, and brawn. Again the cost is worth noting. Arnautovic was \u00a32m from Werder Bremen, Ireland a free from Aston Villa. Hughes\u2019s other signings since taking charge have been Erik Pieters, \u00a33m from PSV Eindhoven, Marc Muniesa, free from Barcelona, and Peter Odemwingie, a swap with Cardiff with Kenwyne Jones heading the other way. Chelsea loanee Victor Moses (right) celebrates scoring Stoke's opener against Everton . Hughes has spent \u00a36.2m in four transfer windows and improved. In this climate that is phenomenal. Equivalent to one 10th of Angel Di Maria, let\u2019s say. Stoke are not averse to opening the wallet. A \u00a310m package for Xherdan Shaqiri was put together in January before the Swiss forward elected for Inter. But when Stoke have suffered injuries it has not provoked a sudden splurge. Bojan has been out since late January after rupturing his cruciate ligament and is not back until September. Odemwingie has been out the entire campaign with the same injury. Captain Ryan Shawcross has missed the last six weeks with a back injury and is not fit yet. Moses missed two months with a thigh problem, Glenn Whelan was sidelined for five weeks. Now Ireland is out with that gashed leg. Hughes has rebuilt his managerial reputation after a disastrous spell at QPR . There have been other knocks but these are important players absent for extended periods. Hughes has addressed each situation as arisen and found a formula to cope. When Muniesa and Marc Wilson were injured at the same time as Shawcross last month it looked foolhardy to have sent Robert Huth out on loan to Leicester. But Stoke adjusted and came through. After his disastrous spell at Queens Park Rangers, it appeared Hughes\u2019s stock had fallen below Premier League level. Coates had faith and is being rewarded. Up next is a trip to face West Bromwich Albion and Pulis on March 14. Last year\u2019 s Premier League manager of the year and former Stoke boss versus his successor in both respects? Victory for Hughes would only strengthen that argument.",
        "highlights": "Stoke City is having a fantastic season, sitting eighth in the Premier League thanks to manager Mark Hughes. They've spent only \u00a31.2 million on new players while overcoming injuries and outperforming teams that spent much more. Hughes's smart signings and tactical changes have revitalized the team, leading to a strong chance for their best finish yet. His success has earned him a new contract, and the upcoming match against West Brom will be a significant test.",

        "document": "Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk admits he feared his cup final dream had been wrecked by last week's red card at Tannadice. The Dutchman was sent-off during the Hoops' William Hill Scottish Cup quarter-final draw with Dundee United following an off-the-ball spat with the Taysider's Calum Butcher. Referee Craig Thompson sent-off Van Dijk before making a major gaffe when he wrongly dismissed Butcher's Terrors team-mate Paul Paton. Virgil van Dijk (2nd left) goes up for a header during Celtic's 2-0 Scottish League Cup final win . Hoops boss Ronny Deila celebrates winning his first piece of silverware since arriving at Parkhead . That left both men sweating on their places for Sunday's QTS Scottish League Cup showdown at Hampden. But there was relief for Van Dijk and Paton as they were later cleared to play after successful appeals to the Scottish Football Association's disciplinary panel. And it was the Celtic centre-half who was left bearing the brightest grin as his side clinched Ronny Deila's first trophy as Parkhead boss with a 2-0 win at the National Stadium. Van Dijk said: 'It was quite a tough week. I've never experienced anything like it in my life. 'It would have been very disappointing if I'd not been allowed to play on Sunday, especially with it being my first final ever. 'But you know, justice was served and I was able to play. Luckily I got the red card overturned and we did a good job.' The Dutch defender was sent off for a clash with Callum Butcher in Scottish Cup quarter finals . Van Dijk is sent off but was later cleared to play on Sunday following a successful appeal . Dundee United's Paul Paton also had his red card rescinded after being wrongly sent off . Van Dijk has been linked with summer moves to south, with Barclays Premier League high-flyers Arsenal and Southampton monitoring his progress. But for now the 23-year-old is happy to enjoy Celtic's treble chase. 'It means a lot to have lifted the League Cup,' he said. 'It's my first cup trophy ever. 'This club is an amazing place, I have always said that. I have been improving since the day came here. 'That is the most important thing for a player. If you win trophies, that's even better.' Kris Commons fired Celtic ahead midway through the first half before substitute James Forrest stroked home a second 12 minutes from time. The Hoops winger also had time to miss a late penalty as a United side that spent the last 35 minutes a man down following skipper Sean Dillon's red card avoided a heavier defeat. However, Jackie McNamara's team will go for revenge when the sides meet for part three of their four-game duel with Wednesday's Scottish Cup replay. Van Dijk said: 'We made it tough for ourselves on Sunday and should have finished the game faster in the second half. James Forrest celebrates scoring Celtic's second goal before missing a late penalty at Hampden . Scorer of Celtic's first goal, Kris Commons, celebrates with the trophy following Celtic's win . 'One-nil is a dangerous score - if they had scored one goal they would have had the believe to hit us with everything. 'At moments it looked tough but Craig Gordon only had one save to make in the first half and nothing in the second half, so I think we did well. 'It's a big boost for us ahead of Wednesday night. We can go for the second cup now full of confidence. 'They will be up for it on Wednesday night and know they have possibilities with the players coming back in to their team. 'But we need to be ready and win the game.'",
        "highlights": "Virgil van Dijk was relieved to have his red card overturned, allowing him to play in Celtic's League Cup final, which they won 2-0. He celebrated his first trophy and emphasized the team's confidence as they prepare for their next match against Dundee United.",
