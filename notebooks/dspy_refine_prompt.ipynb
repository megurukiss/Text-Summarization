      "A middle-school teacher in China has inked hundreds of sketches that are beyond be-leaf. Politics teacher Wang Lian, 35,  has created 1000 stunning ink drawings covering subjects as varied as cartoon characters and landscapes to animals, birds according to the People's Daily Online. The intricate scribbles on leaves feature Wang's favourite sites across the city of Nanjing, which include the Presidential Palace, Yangtze River Bridge, the ancient Jiming Temple and the Qinhuai River. Natural canvas: Artist and teacher Wang Lian has done hundreds of drawings, like this temple, on leaves she collects in the park and on the streets . Delicate: She uses an ink pen to gently draw the local scenes and buildings on the dried out leaves . 'Although teaching politics is my job, drawing is my passion and hobby,' said Wang. 'I first tried drawing on leaves about 10 years ago and fell in love with it as an art form immediately. 'It's like drawing on very old parchment paper, you have to be really careful that you don't damage the leaf because it is very fragile and this helps focus your attention and abilities.' Wang started giving the drawings away on Christmas Eve in 2012 when her junior high school son came home saying he wanted to prepare some gifts for his classmates. Being an avid painter, Wang decided to give her son's friends unique presents of gingko leaf paintings. Wang loves gingko leaves and will often pick them up along Gingko Avenue, near to her school, in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu province. Every autumn she collects about 2,000 leaves from the ground to ensure she has enough to cover spoils too. Intricate: Teacher Wang has drawn hundreds of local scenes on leaves she has collected from the park . Hobby: The artist collects leaves every autumn and dries them out so she can sketch these impressive building scenes . 'The colour and shape of gingko leaves are particularly beautiful,' she said. 'I need to collect around 2000 leaves because this will include losses'. She takes them home where she then presses them between the pages of books. 'Luckily, I have quite a lot of books and I try to use old ones or ones that I've already read so I don't end up with nothing to read.' Once they are dried, she carefully takes each one and using an ink fountain pen creates her masterpieces. She said: 'Some people are into capturing beauty through photography, but for me, a digitalised image just isn't the same. New leaf: Politics teacher Wang Lian has drawn hundreds of doodles on leaves for the last 10 years . 'By drawing what I see I become far more a part of the process and part of the final piece. 'One day I hope to be able to put my collection on display, but for now it's really just for my own pleasure.' Wang's leaf paintings are turned into bookmarks, postcards and sometimes even given as gifts to her her students so she can share the beauty of leaf paintings. But locals who have had the luck of being able to see Wang's art have been gobsmacked. Local art collector On Hao, 58, said: 'These are truly remarkable and beautiful creations. 'She has so much talent she is wasted in teaching.'\n",

      "A man convicted of killing the father and sister of his former girlfriend in a fiery attack on the family's Southern California home was sentenced to death on Tuesday. Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .\n",

      "Avid rugby fan Prince Harry could barely watch as England came up just short of the 26-point margin needed to win their first Six Nations since 2011 in a pulsating match at Twickenham. In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch' - just six points short of the total required to lift the trophy. Sporting a navy blue suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne squirmed in his seat as England got off to a difficult start, despite an early try. Scroll down for video . Stress: The Prince can barely watch as England beat France 55-35 but narrowly missed out on the Six Nations . Taking its toll: Harry looks anxious as England struggled to cope with France's impressive start to the match . Passion: Prince Harry belts out the national anthem, seated behind England coach Stuart Lancaster . Despite their herculean effort, England could not find a final try and finished second in the championship, behind Ireland. After the match, England head coach Stuart Lancaster praised his side for 'one of the most courageous performances' he has seen from his side. 'It will go down as one of the great games of rugby,' he added. Earlier in the day, Ireland thrashed 40-10 in Edinburgh to mark a dismal campaign for the Scots and an impressive Wales ran riot in Rome, thumping Italy 61-20. All smiles: The fourth-in-line to the throne grins alongside students from Reigate School, in Surrey . Before England's crunch match against France, Prince Harry had met girls from Reigate School and The Quest Academy, Croydon, who had played in the warm-up game. Harry - who is a Vice Patron of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) - also chatted with members of the armed forces at Twickenham . Looking dapper in his navy suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne then took his seat in the stand before singing the national anthem with gusto. Patriotic: Harry chats to a member of the army - he announced this week he will quit the army in the summer . Pointing the way: The Prince is an avid rugby fan - England and Wales host the World Cup later this year . Suave: Harry, in a sharp navy suit, walks along the side of the hallowed Twickenham turf before the match . The Six Nations is the last competitive rugby tournament before England host the World Cup later this year. The tournament begins on September 18 with England taking on Fiji at Twickenham. In 2014 Prince Harry was named as patron of the RFU's All Schools campaign, which aims to bring rugby to 750 more schools by the Rugby World Cup in 2019. Looking up: Prince Harry takes his seat in the stands with Bernard Lapasset, left, chairman of the IRB . Role model: Harry chats to students from Reigate School, who had played before England's match vs France . Charismatic: The Prince - patron of the RFU's All Schools campaign, jokes with the girls before a photo shoot . He is also Patron of the RFU Injured Players Foundation. Although one of the most prominent royal rugby fans (he was famously in attendance when England lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in Australia in 2003), the Prince is by no means the only one. His brother Prince William is also a fan and enjoys a similar position at the Welsh RFU while the Princess Royal is patron of Scottish rugby and regularly appears at Murrayfield on match day.\n",

      "British troops could soon head into battle kitted out in the latest state-of-the-art wearable technology. BAE Systems has created its Broadsword range of devices that revolve around a vest called Spine. Spine uses so-called e-textiles to wirelessly charge military equipment - and this energy use can be monitored using a smartphone app. BAE Systems has created its Broadsword range of devices (pictured) that revolve around a vest called Spine. Spine uses so-called e-textiles to wirelessly charge military equipment and gets its energy from an inductive charging seat All of this energy use can then be monitored using a smartphone app . Other equipment in the range includes the Q-Warrior augmented reality headset and car seats that wirelessly charge the wearable technology. Spine was developed by the London-based defence firm with Surrey-based Intelligent Textiles Design. It can power up and transfer data to and from equipment such as radios, cameras, smart helmets and torches, as well as smart weapons - effectively working as a portable hotspot.

Eight devices can be plugged in and charged at any one time, and the vest's electrically conductive yarns can also be used to charge other gadgets wirelessly. This image is a grab from the Spine's connected app. It shows how much power the vest, and individual gadgets, have .

Elsewhere, the Q-Warrior see-through augmented reality display integrates with the Spine and smartphone to overlay useful information such as GPS locations, temperatures and other data. BAE has additionally created an inductive seat charger that automatically transfers energy from a vehicle to the vest. This means the Spine never runs out of energy and can be charged as soldiers travel around battle zones. And all this power usage can be managed using a smartphone app. Elsewhere, the Q-Warrior see-through augmented reality display integrates with the Spine and smartphone to overlay useful information such as GPS locations, temperatures and other data. BAE and Intelligent Textiles Design said that although the technology is designed for the armed forces - and conforms to the standards set by the Ministry of Defence - it could also be used by fire and rescue services and the police. The inductive charging equipment pouches (pictured) provide power to equipment batteries from the Spine. The power is inductively transferred into the equipment through a modified attachment . Elsewhere, the Q-Warrior see-through augmented reality display integrates with the Spine power and network to overlay interesting information such as GPS locations, temperatures and other data . 'Current integration of body worn equipment has not been addressed as a platform design and has resulted in an unwieldy cable harness,' said BAE. 'The weight of current equipment carried by the soldier is far in excess of what is considered fit for purpose. Broadsword is a product family of interconnecting components for the next generation of soldier systems. '[It] delivers ground breaking technology to the 21st century warfighter.' BAE and Intelligent Textiles Design said that although the technology is designed for the armed forces (illustrated) - and conforms to the standards set by the Ministry of Defence - it could also be used by fire and rescue services, and the police .\n",

      "A middle-school teacher in China has inked hundreds of sketches that are beyond be-leaf. Politics teacher Wang Lian, 35,  has created 1000 stunning ink drawings covering subjects as varied as cartoon characters and landscapes to animals, birds according to the People's Daily Online. The intricate scribbles on leaves feature Wang's favourite sites across the city of Nanjing, which include the Presidential Palace, Yangtze River Bridge, the ancient Jiming Temple and the Qinhuai River. Natural canvas: Artist and teacher Wang Lian has done hundreds of drawings, like this temple, on leaves she collects in the park and on the streets . Delicate: She uses an ink pen to gently draw the local scenes and buildings on the dried out leaves . 'Although teaching politics is my job, drawing is my passion and hobby,' said Wang. 'I first tried drawing on leaves about 10 years ago and fell in love with it as an art form immediately. 'It's like drawing on very old parchment paper, you have to be really careful that you don't damage the leaf because it is very fragile and this helps focus your attention and abilities.' Wang started giving the drawings away on Christmas Eve in 2012 when her junior high school son came home saying he wanted to prepare some gifts for his classmates. Being an avid painter, Wang decided to give her son's friends unique presents of gingko leaf paintings. Wang loves gingko leaves and will often pick them up along Gingko Avenue, near to her school, in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu province. Every autumn she collects about 2,000 leaves from the ground to ensure she has enough to cover spoils too. Intricate: Teacher Wang has drawn hundreds of local scenes on leaves she has collected from the park . Hobby: The artist collects leaves every autumn and dries them out so she can sketch these impressive building scenes . 'The colour and shape of gingko leaves are particularly beautiful,' she said. 'I need to collect around 2000 leaves because this will include losses'. She takes them home where she then presses them between the pages of books. 'Luckily, I have quite a lot of books and I try to use old ones or ones that I've already read so I don't end up with nothing to read.' Once they are dried, she carefully takes each one and using an ink fountain pen creates her masterpieces. She said: 'Some people are into capturing beauty through photography, but for me, a digitalised image just isn't the same. New leaf: Politics teacher Wang Lian has drawn hundreds of doodles on leaves for the last 10 years . 'By drawing what I see I become far more a part of the process and part of the final piece. 'One day I hope to be able to put my collection on display, but for now it's really just for my own pleasure.' Wang's leaf paintings are turned into bookmarks, postcards and sometimes even given as gifts to her her students so she can share the beauty of leaf paintings. But locals who have had the luck of being able to see Wang's art have been gobsmacked. Local art collector On Hao, 58, said: 'These are truly remarkable and beautiful creations. 'She has so much talent she is wasted in teaching.'\n",

      "A man convicted of killing the father and sister of his former girlfriend in a fiery attack on the family's Southern California home was sentenced to death on Tuesday. Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .\n",

      "Avid rugby fan Prince Harry could barely watch as England came up just short of the 26-point margin needed to win their first Six Nations since 2011 in a pulsating match at Twickenham. In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch' - just six points short of the total required to lift the trophy. Sporting a navy blue suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne squirmed in his seat as England got off to a difficult start, despite an early try. Scroll down for video . Stress: The Prince can barely watch as England beat France 55-35 but narrowly missed out on the Six Nations . Taking its toll: Harry looks anxious as England struggled to cope with France's impressive start to the match . Passion: Prince Harry belts out the national anthem, seated behind England coach Stuart Lancaster . Despite their herculean effort, England could not find a final try and finished second in the championship, behind Ireland. After the match, England head coach Stuart Lancaster praised his side for 'one of the most courageous performances' he has seen from his side. 'It will go down as one of the great games of rugby,' he added. Earlier in the day, Ireland thrashed 40-10 in Edinburgh to mark a dismal campaign for the Scots and an impressive Wales ran riot in Rome, thumping Italy 61-20. All smiles: The fourth-in-line to the throne grins alongside students from Reigate School, in Surrey . Before England's crunch match against France, Prince Harry had met girls from Reigate School and The Quest Academy, Croydon, who had played in the warm-up game. Harry - who is a Vice Patron of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) - also chatted with members of the armed forces at Twickenham . Looking dapper in his navy suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne then took his seat in the stand before singing the national anthem with gusto. Patriotic: Harry chats to a member of the army - he announced this week he will quit the army in the summer . Pointing the way: The Prince is an avid rugby fan - England and Wales host the World Cup later this year . Suave: Harry, in a sharp navy suit, walks along the side of the hallowed Twickenham turf before the match . The Six Nations is the last competitive rugby tournament before England host the World Cup later this year. The tournament begins on September 18 with England taking on Fiji at Twickenham. In 2014 Prince Harry was named as patron of the RFU's All Schools campaign, which aims to bring rugby to 750 more schools by the Rugby World Cup in 2019. Looking up: Prince Harry takes his seat in the stands with Bernard Lapasset, left, chairman of the IRB . Role model: Harry chats to students from Reigate School, who had played before England's match vs France . Charismatic: The Prince - patron of the RFU's All Schools campaign, jokes with the girls before a photo shoot . He is also Patron of the RFU Injured Players Foundation. Although one of the most prominent royal rugby fans (he was famously in attendance when England lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in Australia in 2003), the Prince is by no means the only one. His brother Prince William is also a fan and enjoys a similar position at the Welsh RFU while the Princess Royal is patron of Scottish rugby and regularly appears at Murrayfield on match day.\n",

      "British troops could soon head into battle kitted out in the latest state-of-the-art wearable technology. BAE Systems has created its Broadsword range of devices that revolve around a vest called Spine. Spine uses so-called e-textiles to wirelessly charge military equipment - and this energy use can be monitored using a smartphone app. BAE Systems has created its Broadsword range of devices (pictured) that revolve around a vest called Spine. Spine uses so-called e-textiles to wirelessly charge military equipment and gets its energy from an inductive charging seat All of this energy use can then be monitored using a smartphone app . Other equipment in the range includes the Q-Warrior augmented reality headset and car seats that wirelessly charge the wearable technology. Spine was developed by the London-based defence firm with Surrey-based Intelligent Textiles Design. It can power up and transfer data to and from equipment such as radios, cameras, smart helmets and torches, as well as smart weapons - effectively working as a portable hotspot.

Eight devices can be plugged in and charged at any one time, and the vest's electrically conductive yarns can also be used to charge other gadgets wirelessly. This image is a grab from the Spine's connected app. It shows how much power the vest, and individual gadgets, have .

Elsewhere, the Q-Warrior see-through augmented reality display integrates with the Spine and smartphone to overlay useful information such as GPS locations, temperatures and other data. BAE has additionally created an inductive seat charger that automatically transfers energy from a vehicle to the vest. This means the Spine never runs out of energy and can be charged as soldiers travel around battle zones. And all this power usage can be managed using a smartphone app. Elsewhere, the Q-Warrior see-through augmented reality display integrates with the Spine and smartphone to overlay useful information such as GPS locations, temperatures and other data. BAE and Intelligent Textiles Design said that although the technology is designed for the armed forces - and conforms to the standards set by the Ministry of Defence - it could also be used by fire and rescue services and the police. The inductive charging equipment pouches (pictured) provide power to equipment batteries from the Spine. The power is inductively transferred into the equipment through a modified attachment . Elsewhere, the Q-Warrior see-through augmented reality display integrates with the Spine power and network to overlay interesting information such as GPS locations, temperatures and other data . 'Current integration of body worn equipment has not been addressed as a platform design and has resulted in an unwieldy cable harness,' said BAE. 'The weight of current equipment carried by the soldier is far in excess of what is considered fit for purpose. Broadsword is a product family of interconnecting components for the next generation of soldier systems. '[It] delivers ground breaking technology to the 21st century warfighter.'
