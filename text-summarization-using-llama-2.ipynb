It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, or an alcohol-based rub for at least 20 seconds to reduce the spread of the virus. You can also protect yourself by getting vaccinated when it becomes your turn. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. The virus has been detected in tears. When coughing or sneezing, you should cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or flexed elbow, or cough or sneeze into a flexed elbow (not your hands). Throw away used tissues immediately and clean your hands with alcohol rub or soap and water. If you do not have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve or arm at the elbow and not your hands. Avoid close contact and keep at least 1 metre (3 feet) away from others. When you cough or sneeze it is important to do so into a tissue or your elbow. Throw this away and wash your hands thoroughly. Avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes with unwashed hands. Stay at home. You should stay at home and self-isolate immediately if you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have tested positive for COVID-19. Do not go to the doctor’s surgery, pharmacy or supermarket. Call your doctor or healthcare team instead. You should only leave your home for medical reasons, to exercise with people from outside your household, and to get food or essential supplies (see the “Stay at Home” section for more information). If you think your symptoms are serious, call the NHS 111 Wales service if you cannot seek medical attention from your GP. If you do need medical care, tell healthcare personnel immediately about your possible exposure to COVID-19. You should only leave your home for medical reasons, to exercise with people from outside your household, and to get food or essential supplies (see the “Stay at Home” section for more information).\n",

      "Answer: If you have symptoms of COVID-19, self-isolate immediately for 10 days. You should not leave home for any reason other than seeking urgent medical assistance. Stay at home for 10 days from the day the symptoms first started, if possible, to avoid contact with other people and further spread of the virus. The symptoms are: a new, continuous cough, or a high temperature. You should not leave your home for any reason other than seeking urgent medical assistance. a high temperature - you feel hot and shiver, or you feel warm and look flushed but do not feel cold Stay at home: You can leave the house for a short amount of time to exercise with other people but stay at least 2 metres (6 feet) away from anyone outside of your household. If you live alone you can still exercise outside your home but should follow the advice above about staying at least 2 metres away from other people. If you go outside of your home, you must always follow the social distancing measures. Exercise: You should only exercise with members of your own household and maintain social distancing.
